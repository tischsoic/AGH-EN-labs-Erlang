# Some small apps written in Erlang while learning language

The repository contains various files written while learning Erlang language for university classes. Some bits of code may be not written properly because I was just learning this language.

------------------------------------------------

To run examples, after installing Erlang env. in operating system, run

```sh
erl
```

in a system shell to open Erlang shell and then e.g.:

```sh
c("map_async").
```

to compile given file. **Remember about '.' (dot).**
